<h1>Study Timer App</h1>
<p>This app works just like a normal study app but uses the Bayes belief algorithm to optimise your focus session (STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT)</p>

<p>Firstly, install the dependencies by executing the following command in your virtual environment:</p>
```bash
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<p>To run the app, run the following command in your terminal:</p>
```bash
python -m streamlit run src\main.py
```
